# Favorite Thread 

Here is a [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/cs40_2022fall/comments/z0h7ar/dont_give_them_what_they_want/) to my favorite thread involving my bot. Below is an image of the comments in this thread. I think this thread is funny because the original comments/submission are very formal and discuss serious topics. On the contrary, my bot's posts are very informal and use terms like "drippiest" which I think is pretty funny. Overall, I like the juxtaposition of my silly comments and the origal serious comments.
